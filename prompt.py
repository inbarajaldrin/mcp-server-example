    Returns a prompt for recreating real-world Jenga assemblies.
    This function implements a complete workflow that:
    1. Scans available Jenga blocks at the picking station
    2. Maps real-world object positions to initial assembly configuration
    3. Reads final assembly pose information from data files
    4. Creates a plan using LLM DT analysis to determine required operations
    5. Executes the plan using appropriate pick and place or push operations
    6. Verifies the final assembly matches the target configuration
    
    This operation combines both pick-and-place and push operations to recreate
    a complete Jenga arrangement in the real world based on predefined final assembly poses.
    
    Returns:
        str: The comprehensive prompt for real-world Jenga recreation operations

    Returns a prompt for recreating FMB (Final Model Build) assembly operations in the digital twin.
    This function implements a complete workflow that:
    1. Lists prims in Isaac Sim to identify available objects
    2. Reads final assembly pose information and analyzes assembly instruction manual images
    3. Creates an assembly tree structure and writes it to fmb_assembly_steps.json
    4. Performs pick and place operations for each object in the assembly tree:
       - Reads object poses from objects_poses_sim topic
       - Moves above objects and captures annotated images to identify grasp points
       - Selects and tests grasp IDs iteratively
       - Reorients objects relative to the base
       - Translates objects to final assembly positions
       - Verifies final positions and updates the JSON file with successful grasp IDs
    5. Repeats the process for all objects in the assembly tree
    
    This operation systematically explores and validates grasp points to ensure successful
    assembly recreation, updating the assembly steps file as valid grasp configurations are found.
